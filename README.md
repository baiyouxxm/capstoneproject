### Motivation:
In the era of Industry 4.0, massive data are collected by the IOT technology. How to use these data effectively is a pain point in the manufacturing department. The goal is to analyze two processes in the project: turning and tension. As a data scientist, I developed a model to investigate the relationship between the physical or engineering variables. We also found out the “wearing-out” model for the turning knife. We compared the relationship before and after the maintenance. 

### Results:
We extend the life of the turning knife by 20% from the big data analysis. We get the verifications of the engineers before/ after work by data. The model captures the relationship between tension left, tension right, voltage left and voltage right by regression model.


### Files:
Tension_process: The Jupyter notebooks related with the tension process. It consists of three notebooks. Each notebook is a two-day or three day data.


Turning_process:  The Jupyter notebooks related with the turning process. It consists of three notebooks and other html files. Each notebook is data from the corresponding months. It also includes the html files of several days by Echart.

Write_up: The overall write up about the project.
